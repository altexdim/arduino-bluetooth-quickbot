Arduino QuickBot 
==================================

This is QuickBot implementation on the Arduino platform.

Instead of BeagleBone Black i use Arduino UNO.
Instead of WiFi module i use Bluetooth module HC-06.

Disclaimer: this is proof of concept alfa release, 
source code is ugly, it will be refactored if i will 
find enough free time for that. But it totaly works.

Robot is based on SparkFun RedBot Kit
    https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12697.
Mainboard is SparkFun RedBot Mainboard (Arduino UNO compatible)
    https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12097.
